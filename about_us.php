							<p>Get Noticed Digital Agency moved from passion to realisation after founder Maria Pomella achieved success with her very own brand - My Jewellery Shop Online. With a background in PR, Marketing, IT, Advertising, and an innate skill from an early age, Maria's determination is so strong that everyone knew the inception of Get Noticed Digital Agency was just a matter of time.</p>
							<br>
							<p>According to Maria, the story goes that "it started when I was around six". As an only child I had the best toys, but no allowance. Wanting extra coin to buy my secret stash of chocolate, it got me thinking outside the square. Knowing my neighbourhood, friends and family always wanted my toys, an idea sparked into my mind immediately - I opened my first shop on my sixth birthday party. Days before the grand opening, I had my merchandising organised and carefully priced, my customers and ambition to achieving my secret chocolate stash. My mistake, however, was that I did this without asking for permission. Within 45 minutes of opening, my parents found out. The authorities cosed me down. My fine, returning the money without getting my toys back. The next day I told my mother that when I grow up, I would open a shop that helps others - a motto that I carried forward. This event shaped the person I am today. Being a business owner, I understand the struggle to take on different roles and responsibilities at once. Being a successful business owner and marketer, I know how to promote a brand effectively, bring small business out to the market and reach the right customers. This is why I started Get Noticed Digital Agency, hoping to help other business owners market their brands and achieve the same success.</p>
							<br>
							<p>Get Noticed Digital Ageny creates a new approach to marketing, designed to help even the smallest of businesses to implement digital strategies at affordable pricing. We give you the tools that reach your customers at all stages of the funnel, with agile and adaptive strategies across digital channels.</p>
							<br>

							<p>Even the innovator, Maria identified a gap in the market and founded Get Noticed Digital Agency in 2017. Forging a path for a digital marketing experience for small to medium businesses that is exciting and engaging. Maria has experience in marketing, PR, and IT - this new venture is an extension of her personality. She is a self-confessed shopaholic, who is hardworking and loves to achieve. Never one to sit back, if an oppurtunity presents itself, she takes it on and creates magic. Her philosophy is that a challenge is an oppurtunity. She has worked with the likes of Australian pop princess Kylie Minogue, and on executing events for openings at hotels like Novotel.</p>
							<br>
							<p>Maria is passionate about mentoring and started the Get Noticed Digital Agency Intern Program in 2017.</p>
							<br>
							<p>"I love sharing success, I love it when other small businesses do well. Having already created a business that takes Australian creativity to the world, it game me the confidence that I could help other businesses achieve great results. Hatching an environment that people want to be part of shows me my vision aligns correctly."</p>
							<br>
							<p>"Success doesn't come overnight and I'm not afraid to choose the path less travelled. The road was no highway, it is like the Great Ocean Road, breathtaking and well worth it. My experience and know-how gave me the courage, self-belief and allowed me to take that first daunting step to pass this knowledge onto their businesses and see them grow just like my business has."</p>
