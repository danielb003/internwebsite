					<h1>Why Small Business Needs A Social Media Strategy</h1>

					<p>Today, 79% of Australian internet users use social media. This figure is a good indication that business social media should be high on your priority list. Did you know doing the right way requires a tactical plan? It is more than just posting, it's posting with a strategy to get the desired outcome.</p>
					<br>
					<h3>Why should a small business use social media as a marketing tool?</h3>
					<p>Every small business needs it - in fact, all businesses need it. Australians are more likely to trust a brand if they have a large social media following. Social media accounts can build relationships with customers and increase brand loyalty. It is also a cost effective marketing tool.</p>
					<br>
					<p>How, I hear you ask? Everything on social media is determined by a highly sophisticated algorithm, which makes it cost-effective when using it as an advertising tool. You can target your customer base, not the world.  A user’s activity feed is determined by sophisticated algorithm, which means what posts, pages and advertising you see are picked for you.</p>
					<br>
					<p>For example, take a look at your Facebook news feed, every post, page, and advertising you see are specifically picked for you. The algorithm allows business to target their customer base, not the world. This makes Facebook, and all other social media platforms cost-effective when using them as an advertising tool.</p>
					<br>
					<p>Facebook is the most powerful social media platform with over 2 billion users. To get your social media working, once you understand the platform, the next step is strategy.</p>
					<br>
					<h3>Why does a small business need a social media strategy?</h3>
					<p>To have a powerful social media account or market your business on Facebook, you need a plan. Today, having a social media presence isn’t enough to align your content with your audience. Facebook marketing for business is pointless if you are posting for the sake of posting.</p>
					<br>
					<p>Poor quality content comes across as fake and annoying and gets ignored by customers. A strategy gives small business a social media purpose and allows you to plan to match your outcomes. By planning, you can define the purpose of your social media, what your objectives and desired goals are and have a direction. Social media marketing is all about engaging your audience with your brand. Without a strategy for your social media, you won’t get noticed.</p>
					<br>
					<p>Here are three tips to help you create your social media strategy.</p>
					<br>
					<h3>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purpose, Objective and Goals.</h3>
					<p>Think about why you want business social media and what you want to achieve with it. Here’s some examples:
					<br>Improve brand recognition/brand loyalty
					<br>Engage new customers with your brand
					<br>Encourage customers to visit your website
					<br>Inform customers of specials/deals
					<br>Improve exposure and online traffic</p>
					<br>
					<h3>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audience</h3>
					<p>If you know your audience, you’ll know what kind of content you should have on your social media. Know as much as you can about your audience, age, sex, what they do for work, etc.</p>
					<br>
					<h3>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Planning content</h3>
					<p>Always plan your content before posting. High-quality content that engages your audience is what gets you noticed.</p>
					<br>
					<p>Whether your business is selling homemade cards or the easy, quick cafe, business social media is a must have. Like any part of business success, it needs a strategy.</p>
